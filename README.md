### Data Analysis Portfolio Projects
This repository contains a few data analysis projects based on data retrieved from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/us-cost-of-living-dataset-3171-counties). These projects look to help discover trends and gain insights into the cost of living across the United States, which affects a number of people currently. Because this dataset resonates with me along with many others, I felt connected to this dataset and wanted to test my skills with information that I feel is very relevant and interesting. Using PostgreSQL and Excel, I have been able to construct insights, such as "What is the average cost of living across the United States?", or the counties with the highest annual housing costs and transportation costs(to name a few). Any feedback is greatly appreciated, as I look to apply it to future projects.
